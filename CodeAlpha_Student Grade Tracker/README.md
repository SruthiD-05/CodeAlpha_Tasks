# Student Grade Tracker (GUI Application)

## Overview
The Student Grade Tracker is a Java-based desktop application developed using Swing for graphical user interface implementation. 
The system enables efficient management of student academic records and automates grade calculation processes.

This project demonstrates practical implementation of Object-Oriented Programming principles and event-driven programming concepts in Java.

## Key Features
- Add student details and marks
- Automatic total and average calculation
- Grade evaluation logic
- Graphical User Interface (GUI) using Java Swing
- Structured and modular code design
- Input validation mechanisms

## Technology Stack
- Java (JDK 8 or above)
- Java Swing (GUI Framework)
- Object-Oriented Programming
- Event Handling

## Project Structure
Student.java  
StudentGradeTrackerGUI.java  

(Compiled .class files are generated automatically after compilation and are not included in version control.)

## Installation & Execution

1. Navigate to the project directory.
2. Compile the Java files:

   javac Student.java
   javac StudentGradeTrackerGUI.java

3. Run the application:

   java StudentGradeTrackerGUI

## Application Workflow
1. User enters student information and marks.
2. System processes input data.
3. Total, average, and grade are calculated.
4. Results are displayed in the GUI interface.

## Future Enhancements
- Database integration for persistent storage
- Export report functionality (PDF/Excel)
- Search and filter student records
- Improved UI/UX design
- Role-based access control
