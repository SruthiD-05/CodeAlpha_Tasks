# Hotel Reservation System

## Overview
The Hotel Reservation System is a Java-based application developed to simulate the core functionalities of a hotel booking management system. 

The system allows users to manage room reservations, customer details, and booking records efficiently through a structured console-based interface.

This project demonstrates the practical application of Object-Oriented Programming principles, data handling, and control flow management in Java.

## Key Features
- Room booking and reservation management
- Customer information handling
- Room availability checking
- Reservation cancellation functionality
- Input validation and structured data processing
- Modular and maintainable code architecture

## Technology Stack
- Java (JDK 8 or above)
- Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)
- Collections / Data Structures
- Exception Handling

## Project Structure
HotelReservationSystem.java

(Compiled `.class` files are generated during execution and are excluded from version control.)

## Installation & Execution
